# Postfixers

Here's is our third and final attempt at our group project. We've learned quite a lot and have archived the previous two attempts below for reference. 

First project attempt: https://github.com/jumpingcontent/Wikinets_Research

Second project attempt: https://github.com/jumpingcontent/Wikinets_Moinmoin

For our Postfix project we'll successfully test the Postfix installation and document the entire process while taking screenshots and possibly log info to verify that the service successfully works and we understand how it works and can properly present/teach the class on this too.
