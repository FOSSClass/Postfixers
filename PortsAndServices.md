Here's the resulting documentation for our services and feature overviews for prospective users.


--------------------------------------------


**Ports and Basic Services and Components**

--

**SMTP Main Port**

**Port 25**

This is the port we'll need to use to receive mail. Mail servers will connect to this port and initial the mailing process.

--

**Standard SMTP Sending Port**

**Port 587**

We'll use this as the main port for clients to connect and send the emails out.

--

**Secure SMTP**

**Port 465**

If clients were to want to connect to us to send mail out they'll use this port. This is a second option to port 587.

--

**Linux**

The server runs on a Linux backend which is important because of the stability and security offered. Postfix is written in C also, which Linux can properly compile and run well.
