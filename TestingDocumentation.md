Here's the resulting documentation for our testing of the Postfix service.


--------------------------------------------


**Confirming Installation:**

1. We're currently testing to make sure that Postfix has been installed on the server and we know how to access it.

2. Right now we're checking the status of the service and making sure that we both know its location and have access to it.

3. We're also making sure that it's been configured and if not to configure it.

4. We're currently running a command to see if the Postfix has been configured properly.

// sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix
